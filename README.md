### What I learned

While working on this project, I realized that I wasn't a fan of the black-on-black color scheme. To maintain better contrast during development, I used a light gray background while focusing on refining the social links profile card.  

One of my biggest takeaways was improving my Flexbox skills. I became more confident in applying `gap` spacing correctly after noticing that I had been misinterpreting Figma design specs in previous projects. This time, I ensured accurate spacing, which significantly improved my understanding of when and how to use Flexbox effectively.  

Additionally, this project reinforced the importance of closely following design specifications and refining my ability to translate Figma designs into precise CSS layouts.

### Continued development

In future projects, I want to further refine my Flexbox and CSS Grid skills, ensuring that I can efficiently structure layouts with minimal code. Additionally, I'll continue improving my ability to accurately interpret design specs to maintain consistency between the design and the final implementation.

### Useful resources

- [MDN Web Docs - Flexbox](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/CSS/CSS_layout/Flexbox) - Helped me refine my understanding of Flexbox and how to properly use `gap` spacing.
- [Figma Design Guide](https://www.figma.com/resources/) - Reinforced my ability to read and implement design specifications accurately.
